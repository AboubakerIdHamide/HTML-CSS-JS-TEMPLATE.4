# HTML CSS & JS Template 4
This project is a HTML, CSS, and JavaScript template that I built using a design PSD file as a reference. I did not use any tutorials to complete this project and was able to develop the code entirely on my own. I really enjoyed working on this project because it allowed me to use advanced JavaScript techniques, such as the IntersectionObserver API, to create a more dynamic and interactive user experience. Through this project, I was able to continue growing as a web developer and build upon the skills and knowledge that I had acquired in my previous projects. Overall, this project represents an important milestone in my journey as a developer and I am proud to have completed it without relying on any external resources.
